Biologer supports open software and open, scientifically verifiable data and we do not recommend users to use closed licenses. Good scientific practice must ensure that the all records from the field can be verifiable, thus for each observation Biologer shows who (name, surname and institution), where (geographic coordinates or UTM square) and when (which date) certain taxa has bean recorded. If a user would like to restrict access to his personal data for people outside of the editorial board (administrators and taxonomic experts for a particular group), closed license can be chosen.</string>
