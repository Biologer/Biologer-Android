This means that data with limited are allowed to be shared with third parties under the terms of the Creative Commons licenses.\n\nThe difference compared to a completely open data is only reflected in the precision of the geographical location and the date of observation. Limited data view allows displaying of locations in the form of a 10×10 km squares, without the possibility of showing places more accurately to other users of the database and hiding data about the month and day of records. Other information that came with the observations will be fully shown. This applies both to the data view within Biologer and to the data that are available for export from the database or sharing within larges systems for data aggregation.\n\nBy selecting this license authors retain all rights to use the precise location and date of their observations. %1$s administrators and taxonomic experts reserve the right to use all data entered under this license in order to produce the documents of national importance, for nature conservation (Red Book, Red List, revision of legislature, defining the borders of protested areas, etc.), as well as for statistical data processing (e.g. scientific publications, protection and conservation of the species and their habitats) but without publicly releasing the exact location of the original data.

Such way of saving data could be useful if the data has been collected for a scientific study, leaving enough time to the author to independently publish data before their publication in Biologer platform.\n\nSelecting this license temporary restricts the visibility of data for other users of the database. In the first 3 years after the data entry, it will be visible only to the author of the observation, to the taxonomic experts who verify the findings and to the website administrators. Data under this license will not be instantly shown on the taxa distribution maps, and other users will not be able to export this kind of data from the database.

Biologer supports open software and open, scientifically verifiable data and we do not recommend users to use closed licenses. Good scientific practice must ensure that the all records from the field can be verifiable, thus for each observation Biologer shows who (name, surname and institution), where (geographic coordinates or UTM square) and when (which date) certain taxa has bean recorded. If a user would like to restrict access to his personal data for people outside of the editorial board (administrators and taxonomic experts for a particular group), closed license can be chosen.</string>
